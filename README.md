# Archived Chaos blog

Static site created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to power my blog, [Archived Chaos](https://archivedchaos.com).

## Backlog / Questions
  * [ ] Organise posts better in source code, perhaps by date?
    - You can just have folders and its chill, makes URLs for folder
  * [ ] Make sure post summaries are good and not terrible
    - https://gohugo.io/content-management/summaries/
  * [ ] Site search? Is it possible?
  * [ ] About page
  * [ ] Archive section
  * [ ] Click on images to view full screen
  * [ ] Gallery system via front matter
