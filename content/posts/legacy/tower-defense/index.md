In Compsci 101 I wrote a Tower Defense game for my final assignment. It was written (terribly) in Java and featured infinite levels of increasing difficulty, it was quite fun! Albeit hard.

Harder monsters (circles) had more evil looking colours. Towers could be upgraded in terms of range, damage, projectiles per shot and rate of fire. There were two types of tower. A standard projectile-type tower and an area-of-effect one, which did less damage, in an area, obviously.

Still the only game I‚Äôve ever ‚Äúfinished‚Äù üëæ
