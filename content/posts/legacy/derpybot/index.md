A while ago now I wrote a mod for Minecraft that added a “Bot” to the server to perform admin duties. This was mainly because I felt Minecraft’s multiplayer lacked a few features, so I decided to add them myself. Her name was Derpy and she could do all sorts of things like store teleport locations and preserve your inventory when you died (which was not a feature at the time).

My most proud feature on Derpy was her interface with CleverBot, which allowed players to chat with her. In the photo above she is singing the Team Rocket theme song with us, she was a lot of fun.

She could also be mean.
